# TeamB Dsl : MusicML ðŸŽµ 

This repository contains an internal Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for composing music using Python and textx as a language development framework. The DSL operates on the MIDI standard and is implemented using the `midiutil` Python library.

The DSL is designed for musicians who want to write their partitions using our language and have it generated as a MIDI file that is playable on any MIDI player.

## Implemented extensions and add-ons

Here are the extensions that have been implemented on top of our language:
- **Support for bar modifications** 
- **Support for human like errors**
- **Support for user interactive input**

Additionally, the following add-ons have been integrated:
- **MIDI Visualizer & Player** : Enables users to witness their musical creations come to life interactively and instantly.
- **Monaco Editor** : External validator for our DSL, enhancing the editing and validation process.

Furthermore, we've introduced additional scenarios to showcase the capabilities of our language :
- **Pitch Bend Scenario**: Implemented the bass track from "Billie Jean" with added pitch bend using control commands (CC), demonstrated in `scenario5.sh`.

- **Regions Scenario**: Defined measures and regions for the drum track in "Billie Jean," specifying the order of play, demonstrated in `scenario6.sh`.

- **Sections Scenario**: Implemented the beginning of "Billie Jean" in two distinct sections (A and B), each with specific instructions for drum, bass, and vocal tracks, implemented in `scenario7.sh`.


## Content

The repository contains the following:

- **docs** : This section includes :
  - `music-ml.bnf` : the grammar defined in Backusâ€“Naur Form (BNF).
  - `notes.md` : detailed notes providing explanations about MIDI.
  - `architecture.svg`: a metamodel representing the MusicML model.
  - `rapport.pdf`: A report detailing the work that has been accomplished.

- **src** : It contains the kernel of the developped language, and the extensions developped. It contains the following sub-directories :
  - `app`  : This sub-directory contains the source code for the interactive interface dedicated to visualizing the composed piece.
  - `textxmonaco` : This sub-directory hosts the Monaco editor designed for the application DSL. For more details, refer to [src/textx-monaco/README.md](https://github.com/benaissanadim/DSL-MusicML-TeamB/blob/main/src/textx-monaco/README.md) 

- **scenarios** : This section comprises various examples and scenarios in the `.mml` format, demonstrating the full range of functionalities achievable using our DSL. For more information about these scenarios, refer to the report in the `docs`section.

- **generated** : This section specifically houses MIDI files in the `.mid` format, generated from the implemented scenarios, providing results that highlight the expressive capabilities of the DSL.

## Usage
**1. Install Python :**

First, ensure that Python is installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/). The recommended version is 3.8.

**2. Install Libraries :**

Run the setup.sh script located in the root directory  to install the necessary libraries.
```
./setup.sh
```
This script checks the installation status of the  `midiutil`, `textx` and  `Flask`packages using pip, installing them if they are not already present.

**3. Use DSL:**

To use our Domain-Specific Language (DSL), follow these steps:
- Write  a scenario following our language specifications and save it in the "scenarios" directory with the .mml format.
-  Execute the scenario using the following command:
```
./run-scenario.sh <file>.mml
```
**NB:**
To activate the interactive interface dedicated to visualizing the composed piece, you need to add the following line at the beginning of your DSL written in the `<file>.mml`:
```plaintext
Live on
```

### Example Execution (`BillieJean.mml` in the scenarios directory):

![launching](https://github.com/benaissanadim/DSL-MusicML-TeamB/blob/monaco_editor/images/launching-script.PNG)

A new window dedicated to visualizing the composed piece  launches at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

We click on `Choisir un fichier` and select `BillieJean.mid` from the `scenarios` directory.

As a result, we can listen to the dynamically generated music and visually interact with real-time notes :
