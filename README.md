# TeamB Dsl : MusicML ðŸŽµ 

This repository contains an internal Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for composing music using Python and textx as a language development framework. It is based on the MIDI standard.

The DSL is designed for musicians who want to write their partitions using our language and have it generated as a MIDI file that is playable on any MIDI player.


## Content

The repository contains the following:

- **docs** : This section contains explanations of the implemented DSL including its meta-model implemented and its grammar in Backusâ€“Naur form (BNF). 

- **src** : It contains the kernel of the developped language, and the extensions developped. It contains the following sub-directories :
  - `app`  : This sub-directory contains the source code for the interactive interface dedicated to visualizing the composed piece.
  - `textxmonaco` : This sub-directory hosts the Monaco editor designed for the application DSL. For more details, refer to (https://github.com/benaissanadim/DSL-MusicML-TeamB/blob/main/src/textx-monaco/README.md)[src/textx-monaco/README.md]

- **scenarios** : This section comprises various examples and scenarios that demonstrate the full range of functionalities achievable using our DSL.

- **generated** : This section specifically houses MIDI files generated from the implemented scenarios, providing tangible results that highlight the expressive capabilities of the DSL.

## Usage
**1. Install Python :**

First, ensure that Python is installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Python website.

**2. Install Libraries :**

Run the setup.sh script located in the root directory  to install the necessary libraries.
```
./setup.sh
```

**3. Use DSL:**

To use our Domain-Specific Language (DSL), follow these steps:
- Write a scenario in `scenarios` directory in the format <file>.mml.
-  Execute the scenario using the following command:
```
./run-scenario.sh <file>.mml
```
